# meme-app
## Project Description
This app allows users to make memes fast and easy. There are two ways to get meme photo. One way is to choose photo from album, another way is to take a photo directly by camera. After having a meme photo, users can add captions to photos easily. Finally, users can share it in any social media apps. All the sent memes will be saved at list and table for users to review.

This app is coded by swift on the xcode. UIkit is frequently used during the development. The app is composed of various controllers, such as UIViewControllers, UINavigationControllers and other customized controllers. Thanks to UIkit, I can develop a complex app fast and secure. 

In the future, I will enable users to choose the fonts they like. All the elements in the app should be highly customized.
